        <p class="twoblack">A personal blog that I had started as a passion project in college (2008-2009) had unexpectedly gained enough traffic to start monetising. Due to the success of the blog and my background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, I was offered my first job at South Asia’s most popular electronics magazine.
          <br/>
          As a member of the editorial board for two years, I attended events, directly interacted with the experts, decision makers, and other journalists in the industry, wrote well-researched long-form articles for the organisation's print and online publications, and trained three peers.
          <br/>
          Since then, my career has revolved around writing, networking, and helping others do the same.
          <br/>
          I was also a key figure in the creation of their website focussed on the Internet of Things (IoT) right from the concept stage. Was closely involved in designing, testing, writing, management, and organic promotions for this project.
          <br/>
          In addition, I have ghostwritten opinion pieces and advertorials in revered publishing platforms such as Forbes, Financial Express, and The Times of India.

        <p class="twoblack">A data technology company with OTT platforms as their primary clients wanted to reach out to the upper management in other media companies.
          <br/>
          The founder had a few ideas for the content of the article. They wanted someone to extract this information, create a structure for it, put certain issues in a relatable perspective, and write an article that would persuade the audience to relook their operations with respect to data management.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Solution
          </b>
          <br/>
          Collaborated with the internal marketing team of the company to analyse the brand’s user personae. We noticed that the demographics with the highest affinity to the brand, which were their ideal customers, are Xennials and Millennials in all Tier 1 and a few Tier 2 cities in India.
          <br/>
          Then I spent time with the founder to understand their thoughts on the topic, ask relevant questions, and discuss whether certain analogies will suit the brand and its target audience.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Result
          </b>
          <br/>
          The article, although intended for the awareness stage of the funnel, generated leads for the company within a month. This was the content that the outreach team used to start conversations with their target segment until they pivoted their business.

        <p class="twoblack">Worked with multiple blockchain startups between 2016 and 2017, while at an agency specialising in blockchains. Most of our clients were new startups and some were serial entrepreneurs new to this space. My team offered content support for the clients' websites, blogs, and white papers.
          <br/>
          Creating white papers was particularly challenging for both the clients and us. Since the technology and its applications were relatively new, we had to include all relevant information that described the service, ensured transparency in the process, and persuaded investors to partake in the initial coin offering (ICO).
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Solution
          </b>
          <br/>
          Collaborated with the clients' executive and marketing teams to make this happen. The startups explained the problem they are solving, the solution they are offering, and the process involved. I worked directly with the co-founder of the agency, who is an established blockchain entrepreneur, for research and formulation including proof of concept, business model, and distribution pools.
          <br/>
          These white papers were the primary source of information for the coin promotions.

        <p class="twoblack">An industry veteran, the brain behind three successful blockchain startups, wanted to position himself as a thought leader and get more people interested in this relatively new technology.

          <b>Solution
          </b>
          <br/>
          We audited and cleaned up the individual’s personal brand, defined the brand of two of his startups, and created strategy and content for the three brands (Ref: <a href="social-media-marketing.html#accordion1">Social Media Marketing—Strategy</a>). I interacted regularly with the individual and created scripts in line with his persona for a series of videos that discussed the frequently asked questions on the topic. These were posted on YouTube and as native videos on his LinkedIn profile and a startup page.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Result
          </b>
          <br/>
          By combining social media and video marketing, the two primary customer touch points we identified for the client, we were able to create a successful personal branding campaign. The client's followers increased from around 350 to over 1000 within the span of seven videos.

        <p class="twoblack">The movement, Colorado Gives, encourages and celebrates philanthropy throughout the state of Colorado in the USA. The most important work of this movement is Colorado Gives Day, a 24-hour period of online giving in December every year. Over 3100 non-profits, 3000 businesses, and one crore individuals participate in this program.
          <br/>
          One of our clients was a non-profit raising funds to provide scholarships to women of non-traditional student age. While the world was slowly moving into recession mode, the client wanted their previous donors (primarily Gen X and Boomer cohorts) to continue to contribute and more people from the Millennial cohort to register with the non-profit and start philanthropy as a habit.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Solution
          </b>
          <br/>
          As part of Colorado Gives Day 2022, our team created a strategy to achieve the two objectives. This included website, social media, and newsletter revamp.
          <br/>
          I personally wrote and designed the newsletters (Nov 2022 to Jan 2023) for their registered donors. To show the donors the impact of their contributions, we added statistics of the people who received the scholarships and how it made a difference in their personal and professional lives. We also included direct quotes and stories from the scholarship recipients that encourage donors to continue giving and making a difference in their communities.
          <br/>
          Took extra care to ensure that the tone and diction of all the content matched their brand persona and the audience’s cultural nuances while being respectful to the marginalised populations in their community. This also helped us get noticed by the younger generations who are and expect brands to be culturally conscious and politically correct.
