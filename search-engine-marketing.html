        <br/><br/>I won’t promise you that your site will be the first search result within
        <br/>three months and that it will stay there forever.
        <br/>But I can assure you increased searchability and improved reviews
        <br/>through ethical methods.

        <p class="twoblack">It is not enough to reach out to someone when they are looking for your competitor or their products/services. It is also important to have your target audience find you when they are looking for a solution to an issue you know a lot about. That is when you can let them know you exist, give them a taste of what you offer, and convince them that you are the solution for this issue and more.
          <br/>I identify keywords related to your brand and its competitors. I also identify a variety of topics and associated keywords that your prospective audience would search for. That is when we can create content that would make your target audience reach out to you instead of the other way round.

        <p class="twoblack">Have helped multiple clients with setting up, claiming, and/or managing their Google Business profiles and claiming and managing their Google knowledge panel. Created processes to get reviews and testimonials from customers, contacted individuals who gave bad reviews to understand how to increase customer satisfaction, and resolved many of the issues in operation and execution to receive improved reviews.
          <br/>A rating over 4 stars is important when running Google ad campaigns. After improving the ratings (once from 2.9 to 4.3 stars) I have run paid campaigns locally, nationally, or internationally with customisation based on the target audiences.
