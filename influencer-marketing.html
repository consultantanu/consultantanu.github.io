      <p id="synopsis-influencer-marketing-text" class="oneblack">To get the most out of your influencer marketing campaigns,
        <br/>you need to find an influencer who has values that align with the brand,
        <br/>understands your offering well, and brings in people who have
        <br/>a high affinity to convert as your customers.
        <br/><br/>I believe this relationship should be built on communication and trust.
        <br/>Both parties should gain more than monetary benefits from this relationship.
        <br/>Only then can you build your brand affinity and customer loyalty.
        <br/><br/>I will help you with that.

        <p class="twoblack">A young non-profit aimed at solving issues in a specific city wanted to organically reach out to their upper and middle income urban population who are (trying to be) environmentally conscious.<br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>Came up with the idea for an Instagram Live series to initiate talks on the importance of being sustainable, understand what means in an urban setting, offer practical and affordable ways to follow it as a lifestyle, get local sustainability advocates associated with the brand, and tap into the audience of these activists.
          <br/>We discussed with the client and decided the sustainability pillars to coverâ€”food, farming, composting, fashion, festivals, and architecture. I identified and personally reached out to influencers who match our marketing objective (Bangalore-based everyday activist with a solid presence on social media). I arranged all communications between both parties and jointly framed a structure for the Live discussion.
          <br/>With assistance from a mentee, I designed and made creatives using image and video editors. We created a buzz before, during, and after the events with organic marketing and by piggybacking on the influencers' brand. We also offered back-end support during the Live and engaged the audience through questions and comments.<br/><br/>
          <b>Result</b>
          <br/>We received an all-time high organic reach and significant growth in followers for our client. They even received collaboration opportunities with multiple corporations, educational institutions, and movements.

        <p class="twoblack">A local brand specialising in a niche cuisine wanted to attract people who love natural, healthy food. They were also curious to know how an audience outside their community perceived the product.<br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>I identified a micro-influencer on Instagram who is a cook by passion, has multiple cultural backgrounds, loves supporting local businesses, and gives trustworthy reviews. Worked with the influencer and designed the specifics of this campaign. The influencer decided which products to review based on her food preferences and the client shipped them to her. We decided that she would use a casual tone for the caption like she does for all her posts, but the content should be reviewed by our agency.
          <br/>We collaborated for two image-based posts and two Stories soft-selling the products and the brand. Our agency also did a small paid campaign to increase the brand recall value for the audience of this campaign.<br/><br/>
          <b>Result</b>
          <br/>The campaign opened up our client to a whole new set of customers. Both the client and the influencer were satisfied with this collaboration and the results of the campaign.
