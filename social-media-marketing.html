      <p id="synopsis-social-media-marketing-text" class="oneblack">This term has been thrown around a lot in recent years.
        <br/>But what does it really mean?
        <br/>More importantly, what does it mean to you and your brand?
        <br/>I will help you answer these questions, realign your goals, and hit the bull’s eye.
        <br/><br/>Branding yourself and/or your business the way you want is what I specialise in and excel at.
        <br/><br/>By auditing your online presence, analysing your competitors or peers, and identifying your current and target audiences, I will design and attune a strategy (and create content, if need be) that highlights the unique story of your brand.
        <br/><br/>Your audience will love it!

        <p class="twoblack">An established and respected self-publishing platform had just over 100 followers and minimal interactions on their Instagram. They wanted to confirm if it is worth putting the effort and time on Instagram to reach out to their current target audience.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>The first step was to understand their existing customers. I noticed that, although the primary cohort of their customers is Gen X (37%) followed by Boomers (32%), there has been a significant growth in Millennial customers since 2020. They also have a small set of Gen Z (4%) customers primarily from a program they had conducted in the past for young authors.
          <br/>Interestingly, their Instagram audience was dominated by Millennials (41%) followed by Gen Z (33%). Since they have a monthly newsletter that the Gen X and Boomer audiences love, it made sense to fine-tune Instagram for the younger cohorts, which included future writers.
          <br/>Next, we analysed all their competitors to understand what they do and, more importantly, what they don’t do.
          <br/>I helped them optimise the profile that was initially difficult to search for, introduced more memes and interactive Stories, and added a content pillar for tips related to writing and publishing. This covered what worked for their competitors and the niches these competitors missed out on. We also deleted all spam comments and created a hashtag bank that did not attract spam on Instagram.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Result</b>
          <br/>The number of followers doubled in three months; we attracted not only Millennials and Gen Z but also a budding Gen Alpha audience. There were no more spam comments. The client started receiving more leads through Instagram and Twitter.

        <p class="twoblack">I was in charge of two projects for a top billing client at an agency. As the second project, was when the client wanted to start a non-profit organisation to increase the scope of work they have been doing in the city.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>Handled everything right from research and definition during the organisation's concept stage to all online and offline presence and activities of this non-profit.
          <br/>Did brand positioning, brand profiling, logo creation along with the agency's design partner, website design and development along with the agency's web development partner, ideating and creating content based on client requirements, and suggesting and executing events to engage audiences both offline and online (Ref: <a href="influencer-marketing.html#accordion1">Influencer Marketing—Strategy &amp; Campaigns</a>). Additionally, we roped in my resources to help with registration and legal aspects of running the NGO without incurring extra expense on the agency.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Result</b>
          <br/>We increased brand awareness for the non-profit among their target audience, which included sustainability advocates and upper middle class individuals in their geographic location. The non-profit went on to collaborate with multiple individuals, organisations, and institutions in their field. The client was delighted that we went beyond our mutually agreed responsibilities to get things done.

        <p class="twoblack">Consulted with a performance marketing software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform for strategy, social media content, and paid promotion. Their primary source of lead was social media ads and secondary was word of mouth.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>We ran continuous organic and paid campaigns on Instagram, LinkedIn, and Google for awareness, consideration, and conversion stages of the marketing funnel. Worked with their in-house graphic designer and performance marketers, got actionable insights, and regularly modified and optimised the content posted and being produced. This acted as a successful source of lead generation for the client.
          <br/>On top of that, we responded to reviews and individually contacted their clients to understand how we can improve customer experience. Although not initially approved, eventually we incorporated case studies and memes in their strategy like I had suggested.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Result</b>
          <br/>The new strategy placed them in front of younger businesses and executives. The client started receiving more leads through Instagram, LinkedIn, and word of mouth.

        <p class="twoblack">Was roped in by the agency, while managing their primary client, to work on another project. This client was unhappy about all the social media content they had previously received from the agency.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Solution</b>
          <br/>Admittedly, the client had issues articulating why the previous content samples did not work for them and what exactly they were looking for. But we soon figured out what they really want—a writer who is as passionate and appreciative about good food, drinks, and music as they are. It was a pleasure working with and learning from this experimental brand and the brains behind it.

        <p class="twoblack">Memes are effective tools to speak about any topic - simple or complex, mainstream or niche, silly or serious - in a fun, understandable, relatable, and engaging way. That is how they became an integral element of popular culture. In addition, they are low-cost, low-effort, and can be easily recycled.
          <br/>I highly encourage meme marketing if it goes with the brand tone and customer personae. Have used this strategy for multiple clients; it has always worked well.
