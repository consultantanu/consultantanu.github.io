        <p class="twoblack">The month I joined my first job, the organisation was in the process of arranging an event for the open source community and industry in India. As someone who is great with people, I was assigned with the management of all speakers and VIPs attending Open Source India (OSI) 2013.
          <br/>The next month was Electronics Rocks 2013, the organisation’s tech conference for the electronics community in India. In addition to the previous responsibility, I identified and contacted prospective subject matter experts and homegrown startups doing incredible work. I ensured that they got all the information related to the event, confirmed for the event, and received transportation.
          <br/>In 2015 and 2016, I took charge of managing the multiple tracks and segments for these events. Even after resigning from the organisation, I continued to manage tracks, segments, and speakers for all their events until 2017.
